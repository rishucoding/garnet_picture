The Router class houses one routing unit, switch allocator, crossbar switch, and for each one port
input and output unit.

Router stages are performend by the router in order.

BW -> RC -> VA -> SA -> BR -> ST -> LT

1. BW: the input unit buffers the incoming flits in its VC.
2. RC: the routing unit computes the output port for the buffered flits
3. VC allocation: the VC  allocator arbitrates the input ports by selecting a VC from each input
   port, in a round robin manner.( so for each input port, selection of VC -> a winning VC is chosen)
4. SA : the switch allocator arbitrates the output ports by selecting one input VC as the winner
   for each output port, in a round robin manner.
5. BR: the flits that won SA are pulled their respective input units.
6. ST: flits that won SA traverse the crossbar switch
7. LT: flits traverse links from the output unit to their target routers.

-----
NOTE: By default: all stages except link traversal are performed in one cycle. Link traversal occurs in
      next cycle.
-----

Route Compute is only done for HEAD / HEAD_TAIL flits, update route in VC.

Once the input unit VC is full, we mark VC valid for VC allocation.

SwitchAllocator does both VC arbitration and input port selection.
    SA-i / SA-I : loops through all input VCs at every input port and selects one in round robin manner.
