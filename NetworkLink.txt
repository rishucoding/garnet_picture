Network links can be of two types: 

1. external link: is used to connect a router to a network interface. there 
can be many network interfaces, each NI serving one kind of controller
(like cache coherence protocol controller, directory, DMA) 
  EXT_IN_ : unidirectional from NI to router
  EXT_OUT_: unidirectional from router to NI 


2. internal link: is used to connect a router to a router. 
  INT_: between routers (unidirectional) 
-----
NOTE: one must clearly understand how the code is implementing the figure
of a tiled NoC: 
  > how the link from router to NI is established
  > how the link from NI to router is established
  > how the credit link for VC and buffer mgmt is established
  > how the link each router creates.
-----
Purpose of links: these carry flits.

For the sake of Garnet_standalone cache coherence dummy protocol: we have 
two kinds of messages. 
  1. control protocol message: size is 1 flit. 
  2. data messages: size is 5 flit



Capacity of link is defined by (bits carried) / cycle. 

These are also credit link to manage flow control of flits travelling from 
one VC to another VC. 
> credit link carries VC buffer credits

NOTE: latency is defined for links(internal and external) and router.
